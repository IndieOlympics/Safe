<h1 id="indie-olympics-safe-space-policy">Indie Olympics Safe Space Policy</h1>

<p>The Indie Olympics team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience in which everyone can feel comfortable regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, economic background, age or religion.</p>

<p>We ask all attendees to recognize everyone at the event wants to have a good time and to respect the boundaries and comfort of others to that end.</p>

We do not tolerate harassment of attendees or volunteers in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, class, age, religion.</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
<li>Inappropriate physical contact.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, we encourage you to contact an event organizer immediately.</p>

<p>Our team also recognizes we are not above our own policies and as such the above applies to all Indie Olympics organizers as well. We also encourage you to contact us if you find offensive in any way, or are made uncomfortable by, our communication, artwork, game selection or event partners.</p>

<p>Trained volunteers dedicated to ensuring a safe and comfortable event may be reached at <a href="mailto:safe@indieolympics.com">safe@indieolympics.com</a>.</p>
