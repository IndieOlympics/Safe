# IndieOlympics Safe Space Policy

The Indie Olympics team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience in which everyone can feel comfortable regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, economic background, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees or volunteers in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, class, age, religion.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

If you feel you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, we encourage you to contact an event organizer immediately.

Our team also accepts that we are not above our own policies so please know all of the above applies to all Indie Olympics organizers as well. Furthermore if there is any aspect of the event, including our communication, artwork, performances, game selection, and event partners, which you feel is offensive or makes you uncomfortable please inform us.

This policy takes cues from the following locations:
